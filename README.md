3. Install Dependencies/Requirements

   Run the **setup_windows.bat**. 
   This will automatically download and install all required dependencies and packages needed to run the tool. (only on Windows)
   
   - git
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - sqlalchemy
   - mysql-connector-python
   - configparser
   - pymysql
  
**==== On macOS, you have to download and install the files manually. ====**  

   Go to the terminal and type(assuming you already have Python installed for macOS): **pip3 install numpy pandas sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python configparser** and enter. 
   Additionally, type   **pip3 install pymysql**   and enter. 
   <br>
   <br>
   Before installing requirements, make sure Python is correctly installed on your system by checking the Python version in the terminal.
